## React Redux Login & Registration Example

This is an example application to demonstrate how we can manage login/registration flow in our React app with Redux state management system.

# Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/davidtran/react-redux-login-flow
npm intall
npm start
```
# Run Fake API Server
To communication with our React application I created a fake rest api with the power of [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) library.
To run the server just do:
```
npm run api
```
